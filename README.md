# Polymer bonds in AlphaFold3
AlphaFold3
[does not allow](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/docs/input.md#bonds)
covalent bonds between/within polymer chains (protein, DNA, RNA).
We work around this limitation by treating one of the corresponding residue or nucleic acid as a modified residue/amino-acid.
In principle, this may enable AlphaFold3 to explicitly model e.g. disulfide bonds, cyclic peptides, zero-length crosslinkers, protein-DNA bonds..

*This is currently experimental/work-in-progress, please also have a look at complementary approaches

and

## Examples
![1AAR](examples/visualise/1AAR.png)
1AAR with (left, RMSD<1) vs without (right, RMSD>10) covalent bond between Lys48 and Gly76, AlphaFold3 run without templates


## Quick start
```bash
pip install alphafold3-polymer-bonds
alphafold3_polymer_bonds --help
```
