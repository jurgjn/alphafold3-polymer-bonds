# Polymer bonds in AlphaFold3
AlphaFold3
[does not allow](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/docs/input.md#bonds)
covalent bonds between/within polymer chains (protein, DNA, RNA).
We work around this limitation by treating one of the corresponding residue or nucleic acid as a modified residue/amino-acid.
AlphaFold3 can, in many cases, infer the bonds from context. See below for cases where this matters. 
In principle, this may enable AlphaFold3 to explicitly model e.g. disulfide bonds, cyclic peptides, zero-length crosslinkers, protein-DNA bonds..

- For other attempts at changing the tokenisation scheme to accomodate things, see at:
- This will not run on the AlphaFold3 web server, we have examples running on Google Colab (Pro)

*This is currently exploratory, see below for specifc examples. Also take a look at complementary work:
[KosinskiLab/af3x](https://github.com/KosinskiLab/af3x)
and
[bio-phys/polyUb-AF](https://github.com/bio-phys/polyUb-AF).*
